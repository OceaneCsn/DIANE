\title{Estimates Differentially Expression Genes. Legacy version. This function should
no longer be used, unless for reproductibility purpose.}
\usage{
estimateDEGs_legacy(fit, reference, perturbation, p.value = 1, lfc = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{edgeR glmFit}

\item{reference}{condition being considered as the reference for differential analysis.
It should corresponds to a condition name, e.g. the string before the underscore and 
replicate number in your sample names.}

\item{perturbation}{condition we compared to the reference for differential analysis.
It should corresponds to a condition name, e.g. the string before the underscore and 
replicate number in your sample names.}

\item{p.value}{numeric cutoff value for adjusted p-values. Only tags with adjusted p-values equal or 
lower than specified are returned}

\item{lfc}{minimal absolute log fold change required for a gene to be considered as 
differentially expressed.}
}
\value{
topTags object, which table element contains DEGs dataframe.
}
\description{
Given a glmFit model, performs log ratio tests using edgeR 
function glmLRT and
returns the genes that are differentially expressed
between the reference and perturbation conditions.
log ratios are expressed as log(perturbation/reference)
