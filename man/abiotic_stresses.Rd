\format{
A named list with the following elements:
\describe{
 \item{raw_counts}{Dataframe of positive values. Raw transcript aboundances 
 as obtained after mapping and quantifying RNASeq reads. Rows are transcripts, and
 columns are experimental triplicate conditions}
 \item{normalized_counts}{Dataframe of positive values. Normalized transcript aboundances 
 Rows are transcripts, and columns are experimental triplicate conditions}
 \item{design}{Dataframe. Describes for each condition, the level of each factor.}
 \item{conditions}{Character vector. Gives the condition corresponding to each 
 column of the raw_counts element}
 \item{heat_DEGs}{Character vector. 692 genes detected as differentially expressed between control and heat stress, 
 with adjusted pavlue of 0.01 and absolute log fold change of 2.}
 \item{heat_DEGs_coseq_membership}{Named character vector. Cluster of the 692 genes detected as 
 differentially expressed between control and heat stress, 
 This membership was obtained after running coseq expression based clustering on those genes, 
 on all the dataset conditions, and resulted in 9 clusters.}
 \item{heat_DEGs_regulatory_links}{Matrix of size 25*654 genes. The matrix contains the importances of the 25 regulators
 on the 654 genes, and was infered with the \code{network_inference} method. Those gens are the ones detected as 
 differentially expressed between control and heat stress, and the regulators among them were grouped when correlated over 0.9.}
 \item{heat_edge_tests}{Statistical testing from the \code{edge_testing} function, applied to the heat_DEGs_regulatory_links element.
 It contains the pvalue for each edge of a prior network built on a desired density.}

\description{
This dataset contians the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to global warming 
induced conditions. It was generated in the article "Molecular plant responses to combined abiotic 
stresses put a spotlight on unknown and abundant genes", by Sewelam et Al. in Journal of experimental
Botany, 2020.
The experimental perturbations studied are high tempreature, hight salinity and osmotic changes in 
the soil. Each factors has two levels, one of them considered as the reference, and the other one as 
the stress level.
