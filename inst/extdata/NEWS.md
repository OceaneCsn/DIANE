# Version changes in DIANE
---

### 1.0.1 : DIANE is released

Version at the moment of the official BMC publication (May 26, 2021). 


### 1.0.2 : Minor bug fixes and improvements.

Improvements :

+ Citation was added
+ Gene IDs can now have blank space round them in the exploration of specific genes profiles
+ MDS was removed
+ PCA can now handle expression data with 4 or less experimental conditions
+ This document was added to the interface in a new tab

Bug fixes : 

+ Custom annotation/gene information file now allows duplicated genes
+ Custom annotation/gene information now can only have columns named label and/or description
+ DEA csv download does not require annotations any more

### 1.0.3 : Minor bug fixes and improvements.

+ Fixed error in DAINE's programming interface (wrong value of the defaut "conditions"" argument in normalize function) 22/11/2021
+ Used namesapce operator in data import module to speed up loading

### 1.0.4 : Minor changes, mainly aesthetic, with no impact one DIANE's main functions and backend. Changes are from merging pull [request #36](https://github.com/OceaneCsn/DIANE/pull/36) from Alexandre-So. 

+ Some code based on bootstrap grid system has been rewrite. This avoid the grey (anthracite) background to show up at the bottom of some pages, and improve shinydashboardPlus::box alignment between different dashboard tabs. This also increases a little bit the width of most of the shinydashboardPlus::box.

+ Numbers in the DEA table show less digits when displayed in DIANE (up to 10-3). The downloaded table is not affected.

+ **When a row is clicked in the DEA table, display a popup with RNAseq count associated with the related gene.** (Very cool feature, worth the highlight)

+ The little loading square position is now based on user screen resolution. The position can still be improved. Used CSS code is in app_ui.R.

+ The little help buttons in the import dataset page have been moved to new locations. This can be done for other tabs.

+ Add "y axis" scrollbar to some tables which were exceeded screen boundaries in low resolutions.

+ Update contact email to new cnrs one.

### 1.0.5 : Minor changes and update caused by breaking changes in dependency

+ rfPerumte was updated and code had to be change to comply with new function names

+ The vignette was improved (mention of seed, and rendering adjustements)


### 1.0.6 Fixes

+ Changed url to diane.ipsim.inrae.fr added license to welcome pages

+ Fixed cutom gene info file upload in the case of splicing aware gene IDs in expression file

+ Fixed not displaying go results for custom org in network communities

+ In draw expression levels, genes filtered because of low expression can still be viewed

### January 8, 2024 - Fix

Fix a bug with normalization : Normalization was using total count instead of the normalization factors computed by the chosen method.
